# intro-to-prog-python
Here you'll find various problems assigned to me in my introductory python course that closely follows HMC's CS 5 Black program.
Keep in mind that if you so happen to be enrolled in the same class and are looking for solutions, just give it a shot first.
The assigned problems will either be on a PDF file or on the given template.py file in each folder.
